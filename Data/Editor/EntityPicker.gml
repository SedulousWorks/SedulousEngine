<!--
  The entity picker (Raptor's editor-gui spec, ruling 25): an entity slot's pick, the scene
  as its hierarchy shows it, the same tree in a picker's frame. The search over the scene (a match
  kept with what holds it), the tree with the scene its top row, the foot's hint. Its close at the
  search's end keeps the value, as Esc does; a slot's own clear sets it to nothing. Code fills it.
